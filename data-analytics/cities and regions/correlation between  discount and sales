# Correlation between discounts and cities
# Positive Correlation (> 0):
# Higher discounts are associated with higher sales.
# Negative Correlation (< 0):
# Higher discounts are associated with lower sales. - preception of lower quality, discounts saturating the market
# Zero or Near Zero (~ 0):
# No clear relationship between discounts and sales.
