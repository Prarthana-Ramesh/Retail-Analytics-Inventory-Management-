# Retail Analytics & Inventory Management

## Project Overview

**Retail Analytics & Inventory Management** is a data-driven, interactive web platform designed to help retail businesses derive actionable insights from sales data. It enables users to **upload their own datasets** or use a built-in demo dataset to visualize sales trends, forecast demand, analyze customer behavior, and identify cross-selling opportunities â€” all within an intuitive dashboard.

This project is built as part of a research initiative and is published in the *International Journal of Scientific Research in Engineering and Management (IJSREM)*.
